##Overview
      
Cloud computing provides on-demand access to essential computing resources such as storage, servers, and networkingâ€”allowing users to rent and scale infrastructure without directly managing hardware. With a pay-as-you-go model, it enables businesses and developers to focus on delivering solutions rather than maintaining infrastructure.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leading cloud platform offering a wide range of services across Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Its flexibility, scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness make it a popular choice for organizations of all sizes.

This GitHub repository features AWS projects that I have personally built and deployed. These projects demonstrate my practical experience working with AWS services and cloud architecture. The implementations are designed using best practices in the industry and are intended to serve as a reference for my future work as a Junior Cloud Engineer.

To ensure clarity and professionalism, each project is presented with concise documentation and focuses on the core logic and design. Any sensitive configuration details or client-specific data have been removed or generalized to maintain privacy and security.
